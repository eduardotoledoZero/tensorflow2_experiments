# TensorFlow2 Experiments

## Introduction

This repo contains all my work related to TensorFlow2 All the code base and assets, are taken from [TensorFlow2 for Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow2-deeplearning).

*This Specialization is intended for machine learning researchers and practitioners who are seeking to develop practical skills in the popular deep learning framework TensorFlow. 

 Code Labs:
  + [Convolutional Neural Network Classifier  for the MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/eduardotoledoZero/tensorflow2_experiments/blob/main/cnn_classifier_mnist/Week%202%20Programming%20Assignment.ipynb).
  
  To build, compile and fit a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to the MNIST dataset of images of handwritten digits.
  
  + [Deep learning Model for the Iris Dataset](https://github.com/eduardotoledoZero/tensorflow2_experiments/blob/main/model-validation-iris-dataset/Week%203%20Programming%20Assignment.ipynb).
  
 Model validation and regularisation into practice on  Iris dataset.  By using a validation dataset in a training run and apply regularisation techniques to your model.To use callbacks to monitor performance and perform actions according to specified criteria.
